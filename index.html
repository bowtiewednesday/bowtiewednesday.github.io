<h1>About</h1>
<h2>Women live a difficult world.</h2>
As guys, sometimes we don't understand: self-esteem is hard for a woman to find. Why? Take a good look at the Internet or TV sometime. The women in ads and movies&mdash;we don't think too hard about them, aside from noticing the more attractive ones. 
		<br><br>
But women think about them a lot. Some of them see those images as instructions on how to <i>be</i> a woman: be skinny, dress slutty, act sexy.
        <br><br>
It sounds more and more like a problem when we see the damage those instructions are causing. The women you see on billboards are setting an impossible standard, and they're everywhere. They're having a negative effect on <b>everyone.</b> 
        <br><br>
Most women think of themselves as unattractive. Most girls have started worrying about their weight by the time they turn ten. In fact, more than one in ten women suffer from an eating disorder (like anorexia) at some point in their life. All these problems are caused by self-perception, and <b>all of them can be fixed.</b>
<h2>Whose job is it to make change?</h2>
There are two possible answers to that question. The popular answer is to blame everything on the guys in charge of the media. It's their fault that women are portrayed negatively, so we can let them fix it.
        <br><br>
Psych. <b>They never will.</b>
        <br><br>
And it's not just their fault. Fess up, guys. We're part of the problem when we talk about a woman as if she were just a hot body, forgetting what she can contribute and who she is. Not to point any fingers&mdash;we've all done it. But it's not something to be proud of. And it's something that we can change.
<h2>What can we do differently?</h2>
First of all, we can upgrade our language. We need to start recognizing&mdash;verbally&mdash;that women have a lot more to offer than just their bodies. We can start respecting and appreciating their contributions, the same way they respect and appreciate ours. Once we start talking this way, the world can't help but follow. <b>Things will get better.</b>
<h2>So...bowties?</h2>
Yeah. It's a movement. It's something simple you can do to show your support, and it will help us get the message out.
        <br><br>
Here's how <b>you can help.</b> Any or every Wednesday, tie on a bowtie. You'll look like a stud. And when people ask why you're dressed to the nines, tell them that you're a part of something good. Explain how Bowtie Wednesday is helping to <b>change the way we think about, talk about, and treat women.</b> Then tell them they look sharp today, and invite them to join you.
		<br><br>
Bowtie Wednesday is a commitment that lasts all week. Challenge yourself to <b>recognize women for who they are.</b> Talk to them. Stand up for them when they're not around. Compliment them. Believe in them.
		<br><br>
It's the <b>best thing you can do</b> for the other half of the world.

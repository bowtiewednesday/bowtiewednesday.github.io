<h1>About</h1>
<h2>Women live a difficult world.</h2>
As guys, sometimes we don't understand: self-esteem is hard for a woman to find. Why? Just take a good look at the Internet or TV sometime. The women in ads and movies&mdash;they're attractive. Whatever. We don't think very hard about them. But other women do. They see those images as instructions on how to be a woman: be skinny, dress slutty, act sexy.
        <br><br>
It sounds more and more like a problem when we see the damage those instructions are causing. The women you see on billboards are setting an impossible standard, and they're everywhere. <b>It's affecting everyone.</b> 
        <br><br>
Most women think they're unattractive. Most girls have started worrying about their weight by the time they turn ten. In fact, more than one in ten women will suffer from an eating disorder (like anorexia) at some point in their life.
<h2>Whose job is it to change that?</h2>
There are two possible answers to that question. The most common one is to blame it on the guys in charge of the media. It's their fault that women are portrayed that way, so we can let them fix it.
        <br><br>
Psych. <b>They never will.</b>
        <br><br>
And it's not just their fault. We do the same thing when we talk about a woman as if she were just a hot body, forgetting all about who she is. Not to point any fingers&mdash;we've all done it. But it's not something to be proud of. And it's something that we can change.
<h2>What needs to change?</h2>
First of all, the way we talk. We need to start recognizing that women have a lot more to offer than just their bodies. We can start respecting and appreciating their contributions, the same way they respect and appreciate ours. Once we start thinking this way, the world can't help but follow. <b>Things will get better.</b>
<h2>So...bowties?</h2>
Yeah. It's a movement. It's something simple you can do to show your support, and it will help us get the message out.
        <br><br>
<b>Here's how you can help.</b> Any or every Wednesday, tie on a bowtie. You'll look like a stud. And when people ask what you're dressed up for, tell them that you're a part of something good. Explain how Bowtie Wednesday is helping to <b>change the way we think about, talk about, and treat women.</b> Then tell them they look sharp today, and invite them to join you.
<br><br>
Bowtie Wednesday is a commitment that lasts all week. Take it as a personal challenge to <b>recognize women for who they are.</b> Talk to them. Defend them when they can't defend themselves. Compliment them. Cheer them up on difficult days. 
<br><br>
It's the <b>best thing you can do</b> for the other half of the world.
